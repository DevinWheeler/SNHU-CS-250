#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?

Interpreting user needs begins with engaging directly with the end users to understand their problems and expectations. By creating user stories, these needs are transformed into actionable items that guide the development process. This ensures that the features developed are aligned with what users actually want, enhancing user satisfaction and software utility.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is iterative, focusing on building software incrementally to allow for continuous evaluation and adaptation. I utilize Agile processes such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives to ensure the team remains flexible and responsive to changes. Going forward, I aim to incorporate more rigorous continuous integration and deployment practices to streamline releases and improve product quality.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means being communicative, collaborative, and committed. It involves actively participating in team meetings, being open to giving and receiving constructive feedback, and helping teammates overcome obstacles. It also means staying accountable for one's work, ensuring that deliverables are completed on time and meet the team's quality standards.
